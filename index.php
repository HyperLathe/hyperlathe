	<h3>Ann Summers</h3>
	<p>Well-known high-street brand <a href="http://www.annsummers.com" target="_blank">Ann Summers</a> employed me to work on designs and front-end maintenance for their online store.</p>
	<p>In 2011 the Design Department chose my visual concept for their upcoming sale campaign that was to appear in the window displays of their physical shops, as well as be that season's online sale identity.</p>
	<p>I was also responsible for the design, build and send of their html newsletters and promotional campaigns, which were emailed to almost one million people around the world every 2 - 3 days.</p>

	<h3>Boomba Chicken</h3>
	<p>I was approached by marketing strategist, communications expert, voice actor, and emcee, Christian Jacobsen to redesign the look and feel of his brand website, <a href="http://www.boombachicken.com" target="_blank">BoombaChicken.com</a></p>
    <p>Taking cues from his existing Wordpress site, I came up with a number of potential layouts utilising his established colour scheme and logo, until arriving at the final design.</p>
    <p>Implementation involved accessing the CSS via the Wordpress interface, and once everything was in place, extensive checking on various browsers and platforms.</p>

	<h3>Bootleg Wear</h3>
	<p>BootLeg Wear is a Los Angeles-based brand selling socks, hosiery and other exciting and innovative accessories. I designed the logo for them with the aim of capturing the look and feel that will eventually permeate the brand and both its physical and online store.</p>
    <p>The owner of Bootleg Wear chose a design they were happy with from a number of suggestions, eventually landing upon a bottle-cap style design with a knee-sock forming part of the 'B'</p>
    <p>I have also been designing and developing an online store for Bootleg Wear, which is due to be rolled out soon.</p>

	<h3>Burning Man</h3>
	<p>Burning Man is a week-long event that takes place once a year in Black Rock Desert, Nevada. It is an eclectic expression of creativity and a melting pot of community and culture that attracts over 60,000 attendees from all over the world.</p>
    <p>I was asked to create a hi-res poster of the Great Circle Fire Conclave. On the penultimate night of the event, hundreds of fire-performers and dancers gather at the base of the 'Man' structure and it's important for them to be aware of location, safety zones etc.</p>
    <p>There are two posters created, based on the original designs provided. The final designs are blown up and displayed in the Fire Conclave meeting point at Burning Man each year. I have also designed laminated passes for the performers and staff.</p>

  <div class="lightbox" id="mystylesearch_detail">
	<h3>My Style Search</h3>
	<p>MyStyleSearch.com was an exciting venture based around the concept of the ultimate fashion search engine.</p>
    <p>Some search engines allow you to search for items of clothing by colour or size, but My Style Search aimed to be the first that you can use to filter products by specifics such as neckline, sleeve length, dress length etc. This powerful search concept may well become the first port of call for anyone looking for a particular fashion item.</p>
    <p>I was brought on board to redesign the homepage and the existing front-end user interface, which utilised real-time database queries. I also set up an email marketing campaign template and provided promotional visuals for Facebook and Twitter.</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.paymentcardsolutions.co.uk" target="_blank">PaymentCardSolutions.com</a> provide prepaid cards and services for a number of popular brands who specialise in global money transfers and other financial solutions.</p>
    <p>A site redesign was required for their <a href="http://www.breadcard.com" target="_blank">Bread Card</a> product, so I was brought in to revamp the brand's online presence, focusing on a simple layout with impactful visuals and an easy to navigate UI.</p>
	<p>The final design needed to be responsive in accordance with modern web apps, enabling a seamless stylistic transition from desktop to mobile</p>

	<h3>Lebara</h3>
	<p>MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator) <a href="http://www.lebara.co.uk" target="_blank">Lebara</a> brought me in to primarily build a responsive prototype for the mobile versions of their popular websites - of which there are eight, globally.</p>
    <p>I built a fully functioning prototype which enabled the implementation team to test run a number of customer journeys and scenarios before integrating the templates into the existing platform.</p>
	<p>Due to the sleeker and more intuitive UX, online profits from the new rolled out m-site almost doubled within a few weeks of going live.</p>

	<h3>and / OAR</h3>
	<p>Electronic music pioneer and business owner Dale Lloyd asked me to implement a shopping cart solution for his existing label 'And / Oar'.</p>
    <p>And / Oar showcases a wide range of talent from the genre of experimental, avant-garde and environmental audio recordings, and the online store offers works by musicians and artists from around the world.</p>
    <p>After initial discussions focusing on requirements and scalability, I decided OpenCart was the best all-round solution for this case, as it featured an intuitive user interface and effective customer data capture.</p>

	<h3>Patrick Knowles Design</h3>
	<p>Patrick Knowles is an illustrator, book-jacket designer and hand-lettering expert. He presented a design layout of how he would like his business website to look.</p>
    <p>I then took those designs, and, following a few minor amendments with regard to web usability, built the site from the ground up.</p>
    <p>Jquery modules were employed, to add functionality in the form of scrolling menus that presented galleries of thumbnail artwork and book jackets, which would then open full-size in an overlay when clicked.</p>

	<h3>Sadie and the Hotheads</h3>
	<p>I was approached by actress Elizabeth McGovern to build a website based on an existing design. For the past few years, Ms McGovern has sung and played guitar with a folk-rock band called 'Sadie and the Hotheads'.</p>
    <p>I employed a simple navigation system, pulling out different elements within the CD cover photography, to perform different functions.</p>
    <p>I also built on an MP3 player that enabled visitors to hear full tracks from the album.</p>

	<h3>Pastiche Band</h3>
	<p>Having performed for some fairly well-known television celebrities, and even Royalty, Pastiche Band needed a site that reflected their combined musicality, and their professional approach to providing entertainment for weddings, events, and other functions.</p>
    <p>Band member Simon Nelson approached me to redesign their website from the ground up, to ensure that all their services and various line-up combinations were promoted in an effective fashion.</p>
    <p>A primary concern for the band was to ensure good Google search visibility, and to this extent I helped by ensuring some important boxes were ticked with regard to Search Engine Optimisation.</p>
